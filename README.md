Some examples include:
- Reversing strings and words
- Finding the first non-repeated character
- Performing addition of two numbers using `prompt()`
- Using `reduce()`, `find()`, and `filter()` array methods
- Practicing comparison operators (`==` vs `===`)
- Exploring prototypes and functions in JavaScript
