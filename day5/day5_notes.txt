How Javascript Works
====================
-When a JavaScript program runs, 1 Global Execution Context (GEC) is created.
-For every function call, a new Function Execution Context (FEC) is created.
-Execution Context = the environment in which code executes.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Memory is allocated for variables and functions; 'var' variables are initialized with undefined)
	2. execution phase. (Code is executed line by line; variables receive their assigned values and functions are invoked)

Hoisting:
=========
-hoisting is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.
-Variables declared with var are hoisted, but their values are not initialized. They are given an initial value of undefined.
-Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but are not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError because they are in the "temporal dead zone."
-Function declarations are hoisted, meaning you can call them before they appear in the code.

Type			   Hoisted?			   Initialized?			  Usable before declaration?
=========================================================================================
var					✅ Yes				❌ Undefined			⚠️ Allowed but undefined
let					✅ Yes				❌ No					❌ ReferenceError
const				✅ Yes				❌ No					❌ ReferenceError
Func Declaration	✅ Yes				✅ Yes					✅ Allowed
Func Expression 	✅ Yes				❌ Undefined			❌ TypeError



Temporal Dead Zone
==================
-The period between entering scope and being initialized where they cannot be accessed. 
 This period is the temporal dead zone (TDZ).
-The state where variables are un-reachable. They are in memory, but they aren't usable.
-The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are initialized.
-if a let/const variable is accessed before its initialization, it would throw a ReferenceError. Because of the TDZ.
