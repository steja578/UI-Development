DataTypes
=========
1. Primitive
2. Non-Primitive


Primitives:
    number : 4 , 4.5 , -2.3
    string : 'sachin' , '10' , 'true'
    boolean : true / false
    undefined : undefined
    bigint
    symbol
Non-Primitve : Object   ( Objects / Arrays )


-Primitives are immutable , non-primitives are mutable
-Primitives are compared by value , non-primitives are compared by address


undefined vs null
==================
-when a variable is declared without any value, javascript assigns 'undefined' value
-null is an intentional value assigned by developer.
-typeof 'undefined' is undefined, typeof 'null' is object

Note: even though typeof 'null' is object, null is a primitive value
